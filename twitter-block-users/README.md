# Block Twitter Users

Twitter is full of spam and politically charged topics.
This makes Twitter a horrible place to spend time.
To help make Twitter a better place, you can block users, but this is time consuming via web UI.
It takes several clicks to block each user.
Using the Twitter API is faster, but less intuitive for interactive browsing & blocking.
This user script allows you to click the drop-down arrow next to a user and it will take care of automatically blocking that user.

If you want to use the drop-down box for other purposes, you can simply disable this user script, and re-enable it when you're ready.
