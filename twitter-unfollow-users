## User Script: Twitter Unfollow Users üßîüèª

### Motivation

As part of my Twitter account cleanup process, I wanted to make sure that I unfollowed all Twitter accounts.
This user script will automatically unfollow anyone you're following.
All you need to do is install the script and navigate to your account's "following" page.

1. Install the user script with Tampermonkey
1. Navigate to https://twitter.com/YOURUSERACCOUNTHERE/following
